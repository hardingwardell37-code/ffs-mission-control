# Commercial craft

What separates an ad from a nice video of a product: the product held exactly true, a register carried end to end, a closing packshot, and sound that suits the picture.

## Clips and shots

The ad is built from **clips** joined end to end. A clip is one continuous piece the model generates in a single pass, from one storyboard sheet. Inside a clip are **shots** — a shot is one *primary action*, a single continuous move at one thing, running two seconds where possible, three at most. A clip holds a few shots; on the storyboard sheet each shot is a panel, and in the finished clip each is a hard cut. So the whole ad is a few clips of a few shots each — and the closing packshot is simply its final shot.

## The angle

Every ad sells through one **angle** — the creative approach that makes the product wanted. The angle is chosen first, and the register, the setting and the arc all follow from it. It also decides whether anyone is on camera. These are the common ones, as examples of the kind — pick or blend, don't treat as a closed set, but hold one lead angle end to end.

**With no one on screen** — the product is the whole subject:

- **Product-as-hero** — the product shot beautifully on a clean, considered field, cinematic shaped light and macro detail making it wanted; desire built through craft, not claims.
- **In action** — the product doing its job or changing modes, one clear move that proves the value; hands-only at most, the proof carried by the move itself rather than a person's words.
- **Sensory** — texture, a pour, a surface catching the light, close and tactile and often slowed down; the sound of the product as much as the look of it.
- **Conceptual** — the product in a heightened or abstract world: an exploded view of its parts, suspended and weightless, ringed by kinetic elements; the engineering or the idea made visible.

**With a person on camera** — a presenter or actor in a short story, always carried by a voiceover, never lip-synced:

- **Problem-then-product** — a person's problem or friction is shown, and the product resolves it.
- **Aspirational life** — the product lives inside a life the buyer wants, the presenter living the moment.
- **High-energy** — fast, kinetic, tagline-dominant, barely any words; motion and sound carry it, the person a kinetic instrument the camera chases.

An ad can blend a product angle with a person's — a sensory macro dropped inside a lifestyle spot — but one angle leads and holds from the first frame to the packshot.

## The register

An ad reads at one register — a single look, held end to end, that decides the light, the pace of the moves, the palette and the grade. **The register comes from the brand and what the brief is reaching for**, not from a fixed menu; the brand's own identity usually names it. Build it from a few dials rather than a label: colour temperature (warm reads nostalgic and inviting, cool reads modern and premium), lighting key (high-key bright and clean, or low-key dramatic), saturation (muted for premium, punchy for energetic), and pace (slow and minimal, or fast-cut). Most commercials sit near a clean, colour-corrected, product-flattering baseline and layer a register on top.

Common registers, as examples of the kind — pick or blend, don't treat as a closed set:

- **Premium / luxury** — low-key light, deep shadow, near-monochrome with one restrained accent, deliberate and measured; the product carried like something expensive.
- **Minimalist / sleek** — clean high-key light, an uncluttered frame, a calm pace; sophisticated and modern.
- **Lifestyle / aspirational** — natural light, the product inside a life the buyer wants, relaxed and human.
- **High-energy / dynamic** — punchy saturated colour and fast cutting, the energy carried in the cut and the grade rather than frantic motion.
- **Natural / authentic** — ambient light, honest colour, candid and unpolished; trustworthy and real.

Whatever the register, shape the light from more than one direction — a single flat source reads amateur. The register also sets the cut cadence: a luxury look lingers on each shot, an energetic one cuts fast. Then lock it in — draw the palette from the product and the register together, two or three colours across the whole ad (a monochrome scheme, or one restrained accent on the key feature), and hold the palette, the light and the pace from the first frame to the packshot; none of them drift shot to shot.

A cinematic finish, whichever register it serves, is a described look — clean shaped light, controlled and precise camera moves, a fine film grain, a lens flare only where a real source motivates one — never named camera gear, which the model doesn't read.

## The product-identity lock

The product on screen is the exact one in the reference image(s), reaching every render unchanged:

- **Same everything the image(s) show** — label, colours, shape, proportions, finish. Only the sides the reference image(s) show are ever visible; no back, interior or unseen face the images don't carry ever appears, even in a shot that orbits it.
- **Never fabricate or embellish it.** Don't ask the model to redraw the printed label — rendered text and logos warp; the label rides in from the reference image(s) as it is. Don't invent a variant or add a feature that isn't in the image(s). Where no real product image is supplied, the ad doesn't proceed — it asks for one.
- **The same object across every clip.** Clips render separately, so the product's image(s) are passed into each one as references, described in the same words each time. Written descriptions alone drift; the reference is what holds it.
- **True size.** The product stays the size it really is against a hand or a surface. Where fine print won't resolve, tighten the framing on it rather than blowing the product up to force the text legible.

## On-screen text

Text is where an ad most often breaks — the model warps lettering, and small type comes back as gibberish. So by default the ad adds none: **no logo, no tagline, no endcard.**

- **Text on the product is fine.** Text the product carries on its own surface — etched, embossed, printed — reads cleanly, because the model renders it as part of the material. Keep to what the product actually shows.
- **Overlay text only where the brief specifically calls for it**, and even then sparingly — white, large, and only at the open or the close, never over the shots between. Small or coloured type warps.
- The only brand shown is the one being advertised.

## The screen-lock — screen-bearing products only

Where the product has a display — a phone, a watch, a tablet, a dashboard, a camera back — treat the screen as a printed surface, not a live one:

- Whatever the reference image(s) show on the display is what stays there — one fixed picture, identical in every frame.
- The display never behaves like a live one: nothing on it scrolls, animates, updates or lights up, and no hand works it.
- Filming it is fine — a device raised into frame or angled to the light — as long as the pictured screen doesn't change; a screen dark in the reference stays dark.

The model won't hold a live, legible or changing screen — a small screen warps like any rendered text. So where the on-screen content is the pitch — a sleep score, a route, a heart rate — carry the benefit through the person and the result (the rested morning, the number said in a voiceover), not by animating the display. A specific, legible screen has to already be the state the product image shows; the model won't add or animate one.

## Wardrobe and palette — where a presenter is on camera

Dress the presenter to belong in the same frame as the product — the wardrobe palette tied to it rather than clashing with it, so the two read as one campaign rather than two unrelated things in a frame. Otherwise the garments are plain and solid, with no readable text, no logos and no competing brand.

## The shots an ad never uses

An ad protects the product's dignity and never looks cheap — and it stays inside what the clip model renders cleanly. Steer away from these, as examples of the kind:

- **Chaotic or extreme-fast motion** — several fast actions at once, violent bursts, or camera moves stacked and cranked too hard; objects warp and float when motion runs too quick. Energy and pace themselves are fine — keep to one clear action and one controlled camera move per shot (a push-in, track, dolly-zoom or orbit all hold).
- **Mirror-flat reflections** — glass tabletops, mirrors, still water, polished floors — which render as broken, duplicated surfaces. A soft grounded shadow reads better than a reflection.
- **Distorting glass** — anything that warps the product's real shape: a heavy vignette crushing the edges, or an ultra-wide or fisheye bending its lines.
- **Product actions the model can't render** — anything finer than a whole hand movement (working a clasp, a zip, a drawstring, a pump head), two motions at once, or a state change shown on screen. Where the product must open, pour or empty, it arrives already in that state and the change falls on the cut; once open or emptied it never reseals.
- **Handling that fights the material** — a rigid item forced out of shape, a soft one twisted hard, or any tossing, flipping or trick move. A rigid item is held, lifted, angled or pointed at; a soft one takes gentle pressure; when no verb is obvious, hold it up to show it.
- **Over-slicing a clip** into more cuts than it can hold — keep to one action and one camera move per shot.
- **Flat, harsh, single-source light** — it reads amateur; shape the light from more than one direction.

Cuts between shots are clean hard cuts. Camera moves are motivated and controlled, one to a shot. Nothing on screen ever comes to a dead stop — where the subject settles, the camera keeps moving; a frame where neither the subject nor the camera moves reads as a frozen still, not a film.

## The packshot

Every ad closes on the product, clean and whole, and resolves on the brand — the **last shot**, on the final clip (it can share that clip with the shot before it; it doesn't need a whole clip to itself). The product sits two ways, chosen by what is best for the video:

- **On a surface** — the product set on a plain considered surface, held three-quarter or straight, a crisp grounded shadow (not a reflection).
- **Suspended** — the product floating mid-frame, weightless, a little mist or a few elements around it. 

The packshot carries a camera move to the very end — whichever move suits the ad — and never freezes into a completely static frame. It runs no more than two seconds. No fade and no darkening; the product ends on its best, still alive.

## How the sound is built

The clip model writes sound with the picture in one pass — a general cue, not a mix you conduct shot to shot.

- **Declare the sound — silence is not the default.** A prompt that says nothing about sound still comes back scored, usually like a generic advert. Name the ambience and the few sounds the action makes; where the ad should be quiet, say so plainly ("no music").
- **Effects and ambient are the safe, strong layer.** Name the source and the surface it happens on — a bottle set on stone, not just a clink — keep to two or three sounds at once, and tie a key sound to its moment. These are generic and copyright-clean.
- **Music: give a mood, a genre, a tempo — never a named song or artist.** The model composes its own track from that. A named or recognisable piece risks the model's audio copyright filter. Only add music when the user wants it.
- **Spoken lines** — any spoken line is a voiceover over the picture, never lip-synced on camera. A voiceover the user wants as a separate track is made as a separate F&P audio/VO Generate job when needed.

Where several layers run, set a simple priority — a line clean and forward, music low, ambience under it.
