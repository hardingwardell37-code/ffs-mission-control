# Photographic craft

Shared by every mode. The mode file says what to write; this says how to write it.

## Two fixed blocks

Every prompt ends with these, unchanged. They are not part of the scene you write, and they are the
one place exclusions are phrased as bans — everywhere else, ask for the thing you want instead.

**Quality markers** — one line, always:

    Commercial product photography, magazine-grade. Tack-sharp, true-to-life detail, natural
    material response, photorealistic.

**Avoid** — the universal list, plus each conditional block that applies:

    Avoid: AI sheen and plastic-looking surfaces; smeared or invented lettering; melted or doubled
    geometry; oversharpened edges and HDR halos; flat frontal flash; stock-catalogue staging;
    watermarks, signatures, and marks belonging to no one in the scene; flat blocks of dead colour.

- **A person in frame** — *also avoid: distorted faces and hands, extra or missing fingers, skin
  smoothed until it has no pores, eyes with no moisture or focus in them, limbs held in a way
  nobody holds them.*
- **Printed text on the product** — *also avoid: lettering that bends, smears or dissolves; words
  the reference does not carry; a mark repeated where there is one; type that drifts from the
  shapes in the reference.*
- **An ad, hero or lifestyle frame** — *also avoid: a room tidier than anyone lives in; staging
  that reads as arranged for the camera; a background that looks pasted in behind the subject.*

## The product's state

The product arrives in a state — closed, sealed, assembled, fastened, full — and it leaves in the
same one. **Never write an action that changes it:** no cap set down beside the bottle, no lid off,
no box opened, no strap unbuckled, nothing poured out, nothing taken apart.

A frame can be mid-use without the product being mid-opened. A hand reaching toward it, a cloth
beside it, crumbs on the counter, a ring left on the wood — all of those read as a thing in use and
none of them touch the product.

The only exception is the user asking for the change outright. *"Show it open"* is an instruction;
*"show it being used"* is not.

## Photographic & Art Direction

To achieve high-end, magazine-grade photography, silently select two distinct commercial photographers whose work best aligns with the specific product and user requirements. Imagine if they collaborated on this shot: how would they frame it? What color palette, props, lighting, and staging would they use? Translate their combined visual language into concrete physical terms and studio values.

*Example reference categories (use these as inspiration, or select other suitable masters):*
* **Sleek & Luxury:** Mitchell Feinberg, Raymond Meier, Robin Broadbent
* **Conceptual & Glossy:** Horacio Salinas, Grant Cornett, Carl Kleiner
* **Vibrant & Pop:** Bobby Doherty, Guy Bourdin, Pierpaolo Ferrari
* **Atmospheric & Sculptural:** Irving Penn, Richard Foster, Hiroshi Sugimoto

**Critical Rules:**

* **Two anchors, not one:** Choose two distinct masters based on the product. A single anchor leads to imitation; reconciling two opposing approaches creates original, high-end visual tension.
* **The names never enter the prompt:** Never include the photographers' names or "in the style of." Translate their influence entirely into physical, actionable studio decisions—framing, colors, props, lighting modifiers, and camera specs.

## Light

Five decisions, one sentence. Never one adjective.

- **Direction** — where the key sits relative to lens and product. Alone it decides whether a round
  object reads as round.
- **Size** — how large the source reads beside the product. Narrower gives hard edges and tight
  speculars; several times wider wraps and flatters.
- **Temperature** — a number. 2000K candle, 3200K tungsten, 5500K daylight and studio neutral,
  6500K and up for overcast and open shade.
- **Contrast** — how much detail survives on the shadow side.
- **Separation** — what lifts the product's edge off the background.

Two rules:

- **Nothing that makes the light is in the frame.** Name position and size, never the fixture — a
  softbox, strip, dish or stand written into a prompt is an object and gets drawn standing there. A
  source belonging to the scene — window, lamp, candle, screen, fire — is set dressing and can be
  named, and it also settles the temperature for everything else in frame.
- **Light is chosen for the material in front of it**, never for the category or the price.

## Shadow

- Every shadow falls away from the key you named. One leaning back toward it reads as broken instantly.
- **Ask for the contact shadow by name** — the dark seam where the object meets what it rests on. No
  model adds it unprompted, and its absence is the commonest reason a product reads as pasted on.
- Give every shadow a direction, a length and an edge. Missing any of the three, it renders as a grey
  smear pooled underneath.
- Shadow edge carries the source's quality, so never ask for a soft key and a crisp-edged shadow at
  once. That is two setups, and asking for both gets neither.

## Material

Read a surface by what it does with light:

- **Reflective** — shows its surroundings rather than itself. Describe the reflection as a field
  running bright to dark; one flat value reads as plastic.
- **Matte** — its structure only appears under light raking across it. Lit frontally it collapses to
  a single tone.
- **Transmissive** — reads by what passes through it and by its edges, so light it from behind or
  the side.

Then:

- **Name the micro-detail that proves the material** — weave, grain, tool marks, whatever that
  surface actually has. A category name on its own renders nothing.
- **Ask for the gloss to come off.** These models coat everything in one uniform sheen; naming the
  real texture is what removes it, and quality words will not.
- **The surface underneath is a material too** — it sets the contact shadow, and on anything glossy
  it is half of what the product reflects.

## Colour

- The environment's colours are chosen against the product's own: harmonise, complement or contrast,
  and decide which. A background picked without reference to the product is why a frame reads as stock.
- Two or three dominant tones, named in words rather than codes, and say how they contrast.
- Bind every colour to the object carrying it. A colour named loose drifts onto whatever is nearest.

## Optics

- Focal length is a look before it is a number: short takes in the surroundings and bends the edges,
  long compresses depth and lifts the subject clear of what stands behind it. State the length and
  what it should do to the frame together.
- Aperture is the other half: wide holds one plane and dissolves the rest, stopped down holds front
  to back.
- Name the exact point that must be sharpest, and what is allowed to dissolve.
- Take depth of field from the arrangement — a multi-item set needs everything holding, a hero lifted
  out of its surroundings needs the rest to go.

## Text on the image

- **The user gave the wording** → quote the string exactly, give each line's size against the others
  and where it sits, and describe the letterforms by character rather than naming a font.
- **Nothing was said about text** → say nothing about it. Raising it at all puts letterforms in frame.
- **The user will set text afterwards** → give the region as one unbroken fraction of the frame,
  where it sits across every crop the asset ships in, and its tonal range, so one text colour stays
  legible across all of it. Never ask for empty space — it returns as a flat untextured block.

## Paid media

A frame competing in a feed carries a little more contrast and saturation than the same shot would
organically, and resolves at a glance: one subject, one brightest value, one accent colour, nothing
else asking to be looked at.

## Words that render nothing

Praise adjectives carry no rendering instruction. Convert each into the optical fact that would make
a viewer reach for the word — a source size, a contrast ratio, a surface finish.

## F&P originality (additive)

Always also avoid: real competitor trademarks and trade dress; Coke-like scripts/ribbons/polar bears; blank unlabeled packs; cartoon or CGI-plastic finishes when photoreal was briefed. See [`../../ORIGINALITY.md`](../../ORIGINALITY.md).
